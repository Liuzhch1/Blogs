Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
The `MinStack` class:
- `Min Stack()` initializes the stack object 
- `void push(int val)` pushes the element `val` onto stack
- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack
- `int top()` get the top element of the stack
- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack

Example:
```
Input: ["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

Output:
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]
```

### Normal method
The easy approach is to add a stack to store the minimum value of each element as the top of the stack in addition to the stack that stores the data.
```Java
class MinStack {
    private Deque<Integer> stack;
    private Deque<Integer> minStack;

    public MinStack() {
        stack = new LinkedList<>();
        minStack = new LinkedList<>();
        minStack.push(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        stack.push(val);
        minStack.push(Math.min(val, minStack.peek()));
    }

    public void pop() {
        stack.pop();
        minStack.pop();
    }

    public int top() {
        return stack.peek();
    }

    public int getMin() {
        return minStack.peek();
    }
}
```

### No extra space approach
What if we do not want(allowed) to use extra space to store the min value(`minStack`)?

Only store the difference in the stack! And store only one extra variable `minValue`.

**Push to stack:**
When the stack is empty, just store it, and assign it to `minValue`.
If the stack is not empty, we calculate the difference between the val and the `minValue`: `diff=val-minValue`, store it into the stack.
	- If the difference(`diff`) bigger  than or equal to zero: `diff>=0`, then the entered value is greater than or equal to the minimum value in the stack, no need to update `minValue`.
	- If the difference(`diff`) is negative, then the entered value is less than minimum value in the stack, update the `minValue`.

Now let's consider pop operation.
**Pop from stack**
When the stack is empty, operation fails.
If the stack is not empty.
- If the peek value is non-negative. Then it doesn't affect the `minValue`, just pop it.
- If the peek value is negative. So we updated the `minValue` when pushing the value that make this peek difference, and the `minValue` is that val we want push to stack(call it `new_minValue=val`). So the `old_minValue` before push that element into stack should be  `old_minValue=new_minValue-diff`.

**top**
Similar to pop. 
If the stack is not empty:
- If the peek value is non-negative. Then `val=peekVall(diff)+minValue`
- If the peek value if negative. Then `val=minValue`.

**min value**
If the stack is not empty, return `minValue`.

---

It should be noticed that the differ operation may produce big integer that `int` can't hold. Use `Long` or `BigInteger` instead.

Code as follows:
```Java
class MinStack {
    private Deque<Long> diffStack;
    private int minValue;

    public MinStack() {
        diffStack = new LinkedList<>();
        minValue = -1;
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        if (diffStack.isEmpty()) {
            diffStack.push(0L);
            minValue = val;
        } else {
            diffStack.push(Long.valueOf(val) - minValue);
            minValue = Math.min(minValue, val);
        }
    }

    public void pop() {
        Long diff = diffStack.pop();
        if (diff < 0) {
            minValue = (int) (minValue - diff);
        }
    }

    public int top() {
        Long diff = diffStack.peek();
        return diff >= 0 ? (int) (diff + minValue) : minValue;
    }

    public int getMin() {
        return diffStack.isEmpty() ? -1 : minValue;
    }
}
```
